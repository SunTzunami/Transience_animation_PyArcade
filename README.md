# Transience Animation

## Preview

![Preview](Demo/preview.gif)

An attempt at making an animation of one of my favourite anime characters- Uchiha Itachi.
I made this by using the [Python Arcade framework](https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade).
For background music, I've used a track called Feather by Nujabes. I designed all the sprites and the backgrounds from scratch by myself. I used [Piskel](https://github.com/piskelapp/piskel) to design the sprites, backgrounds and text.
This repo stores all the necessary files required to view the animation.
Duration of the full animation - 1 minute 3 seconds (approximately). You can see Itachi grow with time (Kid -> Clan killer -> Akatsuki -> Edo Tensei). Background gets bleaker/ominous with time.
# To view the animation
Clone the repo and run Main_long_version.py. It'll run flawlessly provided you have Arcade module installed (No other modules are necessary).
